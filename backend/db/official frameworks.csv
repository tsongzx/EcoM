"2|""Paris Agreement""|""The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015. It entered into force on 4 November 2016. The Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations to:

substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change
periodically assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of this agreement and its long-term goals
provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts."""
"3|""UNEP FI""|""UNEP FI helps financial institutions to develop practical approaches to setting and implementing targets in areas including greenhouse gas emissions, financing nature, sustainable consumption and production, and financial inclusion to address inequality. The solutions developed effectively establish industry norms and provide a blueprint for the finance sector to tackle global challenges and set strategies and operations on a sustainable pathway. UNEP FI also informs policymakers of the enabling environment needed to mainstream sustainable finance."""

the governance processes, controls and procedures the entity uses to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities;
the entity’s strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities;
the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor climate-related risks and opportunities, including whether and how those processes are integrated into and inform the entity’s overall risk management process; and
the entity’s performance in relation to its climate-related risks and opportunities, including progress towards any climate-related targets it has set, and any targets it is required to meet by law or regulation."""
"5|""TCFD""|""The TCFD recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures are widely adoptable and applicable to organizations across sectors and jurisdictions. They are designed to solicit decision-useful, forward-looking information that can be included in mainstream financial filings.

The recommendations are structured around four thematic areas that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets."""
"6|""TNFD""|""The TNFD is a market-led, science-based and government-supported global initiative.

The recommendations and guidance provide organisations with a risk management and disclosure framework to act on evolving nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. 

They are designed to provide decision-useful information to capital providers and other stakeholders. While the Additional Guidance helps organisations identify and assess their nature-related issues."""
"7|""APRA-CPG""|""CPS 220 sets out requirements in relation to the risk management framework of an APRAregulated institution, and Level 2 and Level 3 groups. These requirements include the need for an institution and group to have a risk management framework that is consistent and integrated with the risk profile and capital strength of the organisation, supported by a risk management function and subject to comprehensive review."""
